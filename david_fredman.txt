My name is David and Iâ€™m a researcher at the University of Bergen, Norway. My group studies the evolution of gene regulation primarily using computational methods. We use a mix of R, python and shell-scripts, striving towards reproducible science. I teach graduate level applied programming and genomics analysis as part of the Norwegian Elixir platform.
