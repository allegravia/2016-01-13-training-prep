My name is Philip Lijnzaad, I am a bioinformatician at University Medical Centre Utrecht, Holland. 
I am mostly researcher, but also do a fair amount of teaching to undergraduates, PhD students and postdocs.
My field is fundamental research is into transcriptional regulation in yeast, but I will be 
transitioning to single cell genomics in pediatric oncology. The kind of data we have is very diverse omics data, 
previously mostly microarrays, nowadays of course mostly NGS in various forms: RNA-Seq, ChIP-seq, MNase seq, etc.
