My name is Mark Robinson. I'm an Assistant Professor at the University of Zurich and I work in
"Statistical Bioinformatics".  I teach statistics courses (mostly graduate level) as well
as practical bioinformatics courses (mostly undergraduate level).  Our research is into 
statistical methods for various types of "omic" data.  We mostly use R.
