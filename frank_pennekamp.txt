My name is Frank Pennekamp. I am a postdoc at the University of Zurich, working in the 
Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies. I do experimental work 
using microbes as models and I rely a lot on digital image and video processing for measuring
their abundances and traits. I use mostly R for my daily work but also rely on other languages 
such as Python and SQL once in a while.
